        <h1>The Transition From Pupil to Student</h1>
        <article class="container text left">

            <h2 tabindex="0"> More Freedom = More Responsibility </h2>
            <p>
                There are certain challenges in the transition from being a pupil
                to becoming a student. Some of them are related to more freedom
                and responsibility. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the biggest changes is the amount
                of mandatory classes. In high school the pupils often have
                mandatory classes from 08:00 until 15:30 everyday. Whereas students
                have some weekly or daily classes that they can choose to attend to
                or not. This freedom can be difficult for new students to
                handle, and the responsibility can be difficult to manage.
            </p>

            <p>
                The lack of homework that pupils are used to, can also
                be a difficulty in the transition to higher-education.
                Homework are great for
                creating a steady and evenly workload. The lack of homework
                in combination with poor self discipline can cause that the
                student waits until the last minute to get their work done.
                For some students this method works, but it could lead to a
                feeling of stress and loss of control, and the fear of not
                getting through the syllabus in time for the exam.

            <p>
                Another challenge in the transition from being a pupil to a student,
                is the difference in how the student is graded. The pupils usually
                have several tests, a mid-year test and possibly a final exam. The
                grading for students is often determined by the school, faculty and
                the study they attend. In Norway it’s not unusual for the student to
                have 1-3 mandatory assignments and then a final exam in one course
                throughout the semester. Usually the mandatory assignments do not
                count towards the final grade, they just need to be passed in order to take
                the final exam. And then the final exam will determine the students grade.

            <h2 tabindex="0">A Social Challenge</h2>

            <p>
                A last challenge is the social interactions with other pupils/students
                and getting friends at school. In high school most people get friends
                because they are in the same class, or were friends before they startet
                at high school. Because of the everyday «small» classes, with the same
                group and the high levels of interactions, pupils have good conditions for
                making friends.  
            </p>
            <p>
                As a student it could be more challenging to make
                friends because it´s usually not a «classroom» environment. Instead it
                could be a lecture hall with 100-400 students who all sits quiet in
                their chairs and listens to a professor speaking, taking notes.
                Therefore the students need to put in a lot more effort into the process
                of getting friends than the pupils. However the universities and other
                higher educational institutions have a buddy-week, where the students are put togheter
                in groups and does different activities togheter for a week or two. This is a
                great way to get to know your fellow students and make friends. 
                Also the educational institutions often offer a broad range of
                activities or social groups that the student can be a member of.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall the transition from being a pupil to a student is a big step,
                and comes with different challenges. The students has a lot more responsibility
                regarding attending classes, managing their workload and getting friends.
                These are some of the challenges that the group members have experienced
                in their transition from being a pupil to a student.
