            <h2 tabindex="0">Our thoughts on web accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                Our main goal with the page, was to make an easily accessible webpage. To ensure that, we used
                different tools to
                help us understand how a webpage become accessible to most people. We used WAVE a lot to scan the
                webpage to make
                sure the contrast and structure were satisfying (<a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">wave
                    webpage</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                A small note on the automated tests. When we get a contrast warning, as we did on our “logo” on the
                landing page, we need to consider the purpose of the element. In this case its not really text that
                requires the same contrast as if it were several paragraphs, and more like a logo or purely visual
                element. Its important to balance the look of the page and the accessibility. In most casing making a
                page more accessible also makes it better looking, but in this case we left the logo as is.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the things we had in mind when thinking about asseccibility, was to navigate the page by keybord.
                And while navigating around we found that the focus was to invisible, so we made the focus outline-width
                and outline-offset lager. Here is an example of before and after the focus was chanced.
            </p>

            <img src="Img/without-focus.png" alt="Before the focus was changed">
            <img src="Img/with-focus.png" alt="After the focus was changed">

            <p>
                When it comes to links we tried to give every link a short and precise name. We also made every external
                link
                open in a new window. And the ones from our own page, like the ones in the nav bar, will not open a new
                window.
            </p>
            <p>
                We ran our code in the W3C html <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">validator</a>
                and found that, even after working with the img tag, there were still some problems. We fixed the issues
                W3C
                suggested in the index page (See the screenshot from html validator below).
            </p>
            <p>
                We wanted the pictures to load according to the users internet speed, and the
                size of the screen.
                We used all the attributes for this in the index page, but please notice that the pictures on the other
                pages may vary
                from this structure. For example on this page we have some small example off our code. These
                pictures are not ment to
                be in any high resolution, but it´s ment to be small and just as an illustration.
            </p>

            <p>
                When it comes to the text and paragraphs on our page we wanted everything to have the same style and be
                very readable. To accomplish this we created a utility class called "".text" that is used on all
                containers that contain several lines of text in paragraphs. This class makes sure the distance between
                lines, words and paragraphs is optimized for readability. And also sets the max length of a line to
                75ch.
            </p>

            <p>
                When we first started to study the different kinds of accessibility and what they needed from a webpage,
                we also discovered that a lot of these changes would benefit everybody. For example with the pictures,
                we made
                the different sizes to fit different screen sizes, but it would also help if the user's loading the page
                from a
                slow internet connection. Aswell with the links, first we created them with a screenreader in mind, but
                it also
                make the text more coherent to read for everybody.
