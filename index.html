            <p>
                Welcome to our final assigment! We made this page for our final exam, if you navigate around the page
                you will find 4 other sub-pages with different information. This page will include our thoughts about
                being a first year student
                in computer science at OsloMet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second page is the reflection page, and will contain an essay on the transition from being
                a pupil to a student, and some challenges related to this. Our third page is about accessibility and
                will include examples from different tests and how we solved the problems that occoured.
                The fourth page is related to another course we had this semster called "Technology and
                Society", and will contain an essay from one off the topics in this course.
                Last but not least the fifth page is the "Fun Page", this page isquite different from the others,
                and includes a little game that the user can try to solve. Enjoy!

            <p>
                We were looking forward to beginning at OsloMet! And we were quite excited about learning new stuff,
                and getting in the field of coding, calculating, programming and of course meeting our fellow students!
                None of us had a lot of knowledge or experience within this field before this semester.

            <p>
                After the first couple of weeks, we understood that coding was a lot of fun! All the endless
                possibilities both within Java and HTML/CSS, we felt one could have control over how programs work and how one could
                build awesome websites. But we also discovered that a tiny misspelling of a word or simply a colon could ruin
                everything! We spent a lot of time just looking for a mistake, without finding it at all!

            <p>
                Luckily, after the first couple of times with frustration, there was a bit of relief! We were given help
                from the TA's
                and we were supposed to do assigments in small groups. And as we discovered sometimes it's just a
                semicolon
                holding you back, and then it's nice to have more then one set of eyes looking through the code.
