# data1200-eksamen

This is a copy of my final project for the course **data1200** at OsloMet.\
This was collaborated by me and two other students of the course during the fall semester of 2021.

We were graded on the accessibility and responsivenes of the site and on our reflections on accessibility.\
And we were happy to recieve the highest possible grade in this course. 

My main responsibility was the navigation bar, the /fun page and also helping the rest of the group with html and css. 

Have a look here: [site](https://pedarn.github.io/data1200-eksamen/).
